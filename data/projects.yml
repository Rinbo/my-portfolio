  long_description: This resume, unlike my portfolio website, is based on a template. However I had to customize it extensively in order to make it work with the Middleman framework. In particular making the jquery dependencies fly was a hazzle. Projects, experience and certificates are stored in a yaml file and coded in partials using a ruby loop. The partials are then rendered on in the index file. This makes for a very tidy and clean code base. As a matter of fact, the index file is just 15 lines of code.

  long_description: This is a twitter-like microblog that I created to prepare for Craft Academy. Sign-up (complete with activation email through Heroku addon SendGrid), make microposts and post images (which get stored on AWS S3). Follow other users and have them follow you.

  long_description: The classic Rock Paper Sciccor game in a web interface that I made as part of a tech interview training exercise at Craft Academy. I began by prototyping the game in ruby and then went on to implement it in JavaScript using a testdriven approach with Chai and cucumber.

  long_description: This project is my attempt at putting my machine learning training into practice. I wanted to make a digit recognition model that was able to achieve a non-trivial level of accuracy. After having programmed a dozen different models that only reached around 95-96% accuracy on the cross validation set, I decided to leverege my experience from those models. The result was this network which uses dropout for regularization and leaky rectified units for activation. Due to the nature of dropout the training took one week (on my PC that I locked in a closet). The result was 98.02% accuracy on the crossvalidation set which I am quite proud of. No external libraries were used.

  long_description: This app is a playful experimentation with react. I took several lessons in React at Code Academy, and afterwards I wanted to make something to solidify that knowledge. It is quite trivial but makes use of many React practices.
