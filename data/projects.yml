  long_description: I wanted to create an app similar to 10FastFingers but for coders, and this was the result. I used only functional components, and global state management was achieved with with pure react (react context).

  long_description: This project is my attempt at putting my machine learning training into practice. I wanted to make a digit recognition model that was able to achieve a non-trivial level of accuracy. After having programmed a dozen different models that only reached around 95-96% accuracy on the cross validation set, I decided to leverege my experience from those models. The result was this network which uses dropout for regularization and leaky rectified units for activation. Due to the nature of dropout the training took one week (on my PC that I locked in a closet). The result was 98.02% accuracy on the crossvalidation set which I am quite proud of. No external libraries were used.

  long_description: This was the final project Craft Academy. We developed this app for a client who wanted an MVP of an app that he had been planning for a while. A manager can enter his/her employees and the different shifts that are relevant for that compnay. This information is then passed on to an API endpoint for calculation of an optimized schedule based on a number of parameters.
