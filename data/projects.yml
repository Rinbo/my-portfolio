  long_description: This is my resume site which I have implemented using the Middleman framework and deployed to Netlify. Projects, experience and certificates are stored in a yaml file and coded in partials using a ruby loop. The partials are then rendered in the index file. This makes for a very tidy and clean code base. As a matter of fact, the index file is just 15 lines of code. The resume site, unlike my portfolio site, is based on a templete.

  long_description: This was the final project Craft Academy. We developed this app for a client who wanted an MVP of an app that he had been planning for a while. A manager can enter his/her employees and the different shifts that are relevant for that compnay. This information is then passed on to an API endpoint for calculation of an optimized schedule based on a number of parameters.

  long_description: This project is my attempt at putting my machine learning training into practice. I wanted to make a digit recognition model that was able to achieve a non-trivial level of accuracy. After having programmed a dozen different models that only reached around 95-96% accuracy on the cross validation set, I decided to leverege my experience from those models. The result was this network which uses dropout for regularization and leaky rectified units for activation. Due to the nature of dropout the training took one week (on my PC that I locked in a closet). The result was 98.02% accuracy on the crossvalidation set which I am quite proud of. No external libraries were used.

  long_description: This project was developed together with two class mates at Craft Academy by following agile methodologies. We had five days to come up with a concept, make a design sprint and then implement our feature stories. Upon entering the site, the user is asked for their political affiliation. Then they get served news from the opposite end of the political spectrum using API requests to newsapi.org. Signup can be made through facebook and a user can also make donations to us with Stripe. The app uses continuous integration and deployment.

  long_description: This is the client side (mobile app) of the cooper application. A user can enter his/her cooper data and be served an evaluation. If the users want to store their results and see historical data presented in graphs, they must signup to the application. When doing this the client makes a call to a backend rails application which manages user authentification and storage in a PostgreSQL database (see backend app in projects).
