            %li I live in #{link_to("Gothenburg", "https://goo.gl/maps/xWpNcso8dv62")} together with my wife and two wonderful young boys. A few years back I started programming for fun on my spare time. I loved the instant feedback and the creative process of writing code. For that reason I decided to attend the bootcamp at Craft Academy and study software development full time. My interests include programming, philosophy, MMA, computer games, Star Trek and the culinary delights of this great planet.
