            %li I live in #{link_to("Gothenburg", "https://goo.gl/maps/xWpNcso8dv62")} together with my wife and two wonderful young boys. A few years back I started programming for fun on my spare time. I loved the instant feedback and the creative process of writing code. For that reason I decided to attend the bootcamp at Craft Academy to jump start my career in software development. This paid off as I was able to land a job at FrontEdge IT. My interests include programming, MMA and good food.
